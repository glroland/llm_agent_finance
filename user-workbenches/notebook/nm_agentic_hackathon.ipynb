    "\n",
    "An <b>agentic workflow</b> is a multi-step sequence of tasks or decisions whose orchestration is handled by AI agents. In Generative AI, AI agents are Large Language Models (or \"Large Action Models\" in this context) that can perform goal-oriented tasks with minimal human intervention. Such tasks may include everything from simple reasoning tasks to complex decision making, and often involve interaction with external resources or systems (called \"tools\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The following will build an agentic workflow for writing finance articles. The workflow consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   A **searcher** agent (LLM + search tool) which will search the web for relevant links based on user input.\n",
    "2.   An **outliner** node (LLM) which will generate a suitable outline for the article.\n",
    "3.   A **writer** node (LLM) which will generate the final article.\n",
    "4.   A **critic** node (LLM) which will critique the writer's output and provide feedback to the **writer** for improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "<h3>What is the difference between an agentic framework and an agentic orchestration framework?</h3>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different schools of thought about agentic orchestration frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic orchestration can refer to <b>agent-of-agent</b> systems, which are defined based on the number of agents. In this case, they are simply agentic systems that consist of more than a single agent. Hence, it can refer to agentic systems with multiple agents; it can also refer to agentic systems that invoke other agentic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, agentic orchestration can also be used to distinguish complex multi-agent systems from simpler agentic systems. In this case, agentic orchestration is only necessary for systems with high levels of complexity. This is based on not just the number of agents, but other factors such as the types of flows (directed versus cyclic).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many frameworks that can be used for building agentic workflows. Due to their reasoning and decision-making abilities, LLMs are a natural fit for driving autonomous workflows. However, users often want the ability to extend, constrain or even override aspects of the flow. For example, they may need a way to dynamically limit cycles, manage state across disparate tools, or integrate human-in-the-loop fedback. A popular approach is to use <b>LLM orchestration</b> frameworks. These are frameworks that combine the flexible and dynamic capabilities of agent-driven workflows with low-level control over essential details of the orchestration. This notebook uses <b>LangChain</b> to build the AI agents, and <b>LangGraph</b> to build the agentic workflow that orchestrates the agents."

In our view, the degree to which \\ninvestment portfolios are aligned with the broadly adopted policy target of net-zero emissions by 2050 represents an important source \\nof risk and opportunity. \\nIn November 2022, we  wrote  about 11 key issues asset owners should consider if they have adopted net-zero commitments in their \\nportfolios. One of these considerations is the need to set and deliver on portfolio net-zero targets. 1 Even investors without explicit \\nnet-zero commitments of their own may want to know which companies may be leading or lagging in their pursuit of a net-zero \\ncommitment. This will require investors to measure and monitor corporate emissions-reduction progress with rigor and, where they do \\nhave net-zero portfolio targets, identify where and how they might help to pursue such targets. \\n“Rigor” is the key word, here. Of the world’s largest publicly traded companies, 41% have made public net-zero commitments, and it is \\nreported that more than 4,500 companies are now working with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to set emissions reduction \\ntargets. 2 However, a recent report from the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) shows that, in spite of those commitments, \\ncompanies are not developing credible transition plans fast enough: among 18,600 companies globally, only 0.4% have developed \\nwhat the CDP considers to be a credible transition plan. In particular, companies lack the right financial planning, targets, and strategy \\nto execute their commitment. \\nMoreover, good data is hard to come by. The IIGCC recently published a guide for investors on how to engage with private data \\nvendors to help improve the quality and usability of the data that goes into net-zero alignment assessments and target setting, \\nbecause it found the coverage provided by the 16 leading vendors it assessed to be inconsistent, “ranging from multiple options for \\nwell-covered criteria (e.g. decarbonisation targets) to scarce for more innovative criteria (e.g. CAPEX alignment, just transition).” \\nAt the moment, the IIGCC notes, investors need to “aggregate multiple datasets and assess an asset’s performance internally, which \\nis especially problematic for investors with constraints on resources and technical expertise.” 3    \\n\\n1https://www.nb.com/en/us/insights/whitepaper-key-considerations-when-navigating-the-net-zero-transition\\n2https://zerotracker.net/ and https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action\\n3https://www.iigcc.org/resource/six-asks-of-data-vendors-improving-net-zero-data-provision/ NET-ZERO ALIGNMENT: BEYOND THE NUMBERS 3\\n\\nIt is Tempting to Follow a Net-Zero Index—But Suboptimal \\nFaced with this challenge, it may be tempting simply to track or refer to one of the net-zero benchmarks currently available or being \\ndeveloped by index providers and climate data vendors. These have proliferating since the appearance, in 2019, of the European \\nUnion’s regulation covering “Paris-Aligned” and “Climate Transition” investment benchmarks (PABs, CTBs). \\nHowever, as the IIGCC put it in a recent paper on “Enhancing the Quality of Net Zero Benchmarks,” while this regulation has “provided \\na step in the right direction,” it “does not meet the full ambitions of an investor targeting net zero.” 4\\nTo understand why, consider that the E.U. regulation requires that a benchmark must exhibit a 50% reduction in carbon intensity \\nversus the broad index at launch to qualify for the sought-after PAB label. Traditional measures such as carbon footprint and carbon \\nintensity are useful, in that they are comparable across companies and portfolios, but there are major pitfalls associated with relying \\nheavily on them for net-zero alignment assessments. \\nFor example, they are backward-looking and can lag financial disclosures by two years or more. Economic and other macro shocks \\ncan change these metrics without changing a company’s overall emissions profile—think of how a recession lowers carbon-intensive \\nmanufacturing, for example, or how the pandemic decimated air travel. \\nPerhaps most importantly, they are insensitive to the specifics of particular sectors: given the feasibility of renewable energy solutions \\nfor electrical utilities, it might be reasonable to expect those companies to front-load their emissions reductions, perhaps achieving \\n50% by 2030; for aviation, however, a 25% reduction by 2030 followed by faster reductions thereafter might be more realistic, given \\nthe current limitations of sustainable aviation fuel options. As a result, the IIGCC observes, “benchmarks implementing the regulations \\nhave a tendency to comply with emission reduction targets through capital reallocation, achieving emissions reductions by reducing \\nthe weight of the highest emitting sectors relative to others.” 5\\nThat not only results in major sectoral bets against the broad market. It also forgoes what we believe are significant opportunities to \\nprovide capital to, and engage with, businesses that have credible opportunities to improve their emissions performance. We agree \\nwith the IIGCC that this bias against inclusion and engagement and toward divestment is not “best practice”—which should “aim to \\npromote real world emissions reductions” rather than just reported emissions in portfolios. 6\\nFor these reasons, investors who want to include transitioning businesses as well as low-emission businesses in their portfolios cannot \\nrely on the current index benchmarks, in our view. We believe investors need to be able to identify those companies that are genuinely \\nwilling and able to reduce emissions, and carry out rigorous ongoing measurement and monitoring of their progress. \\nThis is the case for developing a way to assess net-zero alignment independently, and what motivated us to develop our own Net-Zero \\nAlignment Indicator. \\nNet-Zero Alignment Indicator Quantitative Input: Multiple Data Points, Forward-Looking, \\nSector-Appropriate \\nBeing forward-looking and sector-specific are important considerations evident in the Net-Zero Investment Framework (NZIF) \\ndeveloped by the IIGCC, which sets out the criteria a company should meet to be considered net-zero aligned. 7 This framework \\nprovided the starting point for development of our own Indicator. \\nThe NB Net-Zero Alignment process involves three steps: \\n\\n\\nGenerating a quantitative score for six net-zero alignment sub-indicators \\n\\n\\nAnalyst validation, with the option to override the initial quantitative scores \\n\\n\\nSumming those scores into a final net-zero alignment score, mapped to a net-zero alignment status      \\n\\n\\n\\n4IGCC-Enhancing-the-Quality-of-Net-Zero-Benchmarks.pdf\\n5IGCC-Enhancing-the-Quality-of-Net-Zero-Benchmarks.pdf\\n6IGCC-Enhancing-the-Quality-of-Net-Zero-Benchmarks.pdf\\n7https://www.iigcc.org/download/net-zero-investment-framework-implementation-guide/?wpdmdl=4425&refresh=63052325dd0171661281061 4NET-ZERO ALIGNMENT: BEYOND THE NUMBERS\\n\\nOur quantitative process currently involves gathering more than 30 binary and numerical data points from third-party vendors. These \\nfeed into the six sub-indicators listed below, which mirror the criteria set out by the IIGCC. Note that sub-indicators 1, 2, 5 and 6 are \\nall forward-looking. As the accuracy and availability of data improves, we expect to be able to accommodate new data points and \\neven new sub-indicators when appropriate. \\nThe current sub-indicators are: \\n\\n\\nLong-Term Ambition \\n\\n\\nShort- and Medium-Term Targets \\n\\n\\nEmissions Performance \\n\\n\\nDisclosure \\n\\n\\nDecarbonization Strategy \\n\\n\\nCapital Allocation \\n\\n\\nWe found a binary Aligned/Not Aligned scoring system to be insufficient to capture the nuances of many companies’ status and \\nprogress, so we generate a score between 1 (lowest) and 5 (highest) for each of the six sub-indicators, using the relevant items \\nfrom our set of 30-plus data points from third-party vendors. We aim for data redundancy by drawing on multiple data points for \\neach component of each sub-indicator, where possible, so that if one third-party vendor is missing data for a company, we give that \\ncompany a further opportunity to source this data from another provider. We also think some data inputs are more credible than \\nothers. Having an approved Science-Based Target, for example, should count for more than announcing a minimal reduction target \\nin operational emissions. To reflect this, some data points contribute more to the sub-indicator score than others. \\nSector-appropriateness is built into the quantitative process in two ways. \\nFirst, a number of the data points we use come with sector-specificity built in. For example, for the same data point on \\ndecarbonization strategy, a bank’s strategy would be scored on green finance targets, whereas an auto manufacturer’s would be \\nscored on electric vehicle revenue targets and a utility’s would be scored on the target for renewables in its energy mix. \\nSecond, while we apply every criterion to all companies, we give issuers in sectors that are classified as low-impact by the IIGCC a +2 \\nboost to their scores on “Long-Term Ambition” and “Short- and Medium-Term Targets” (subject to a capped total score of 5 for each \\nsub-indicator), to recognize the lesser importance this action has when the hurdle to achieving net-zero emissions is lower. \\nThe sub-indicator scores, along with the low-impact boost where applicable, are then summed to generate an overall net-zero \\nalignment score between 1 and 30, and that overall score is used to map and assign the issuer one of five alignment statuses: \\n\\n\\nAchieving net zero \\n\\n\\nAligned with a net-zero pathway \\n\\n\\nAligning with a net-zero pathway \\n\\n\\nCommitted to aligning with a net-zero pathway \\n\\n\\nNot aligned \\n\\n\\nWe assign one alignment status per company, which is agreed and applied across asset classes.   \\n\\n1https://www.iigcc.org/download/net-zero-investment-framework-implementation-guide/?wpdmdl=4425&refresh=63052325dd0171661281061 NET-ZERO ALIGNMENT: BEYOND THE NUMBERS 5\\n\\n1 LONG-TERM AMBITION \\nAssesses whether an issuer has a credible, stated \\ngoal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 \\n2 SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM TARGETS \\nAssesses whether an issuer has credible, stated \\nshort- and medium-term emissions targets that \\ncover all relevant emissions scopes \\n3 EMISSIONS PERFORMANCE \\nAssesses whether an issuer’s historical, current and \\nprojected emissions puts it on track to achieve a \\nnet-zero goal \\n4 DISCLOSURE \\nAssesses the quality of an issuer’s emissions disclosure \\nacross Scope 1, 2 and material Scope 3 emissions \\n5 DECARBONIZATION STRATEGY \\nAssesses whether an issuer has a credible, quantified \\nstrategy to decarbonize its business model over time \\n6 CAPITAL ALLOCATION \\nAssesses whether an issuer’s capital allocation \\ndecisions are consistent with a net-zero goal \\n\\nALIGNMENT STATUS\\nAchieving a Net-Zero Pathway\\nAligned With a Net-Zero Pathway\\nAligning With a Net-Zero Pathway\\nCommitted to Aligning\\nWith a Net-Zero Pathway\\nNot Aligned\\nNot Known\\nor Not Yet Assessed\\n\\nQualitative Input: The Critical Contribution of Analysts \\nOur analysts act as overseers and potentially overriders of the quantitative scoring for each issuer. The analyst sees all of the data \\npoints gathered from third-party vendors, and the resulting preliminary score, from 1 to 5, for each of the six sub-indicators. At this \\npoint, should the analyst covering an issuer believe that any of these scores merit an upgrade or downgrade, they can override it, \\nbut each override must be backed by evidence from a direct engagement with the company, the company’s sustainability report, \\nor a credible third-party source. \\nWhy do the quantitative inputs require analyst oversight? Because some of the data is backward-looking, some is reported with \\nsubstantial lags, and most covers only public-listed, large-cap, investment-grade and developed-market issuers. Analysts with multi-\\nyear experience of an issuer may have more up-to-date or nuanced intelligence on particular net-zero alignment criteria. Their fuller \\nunderstanding of the sector they specialize in may also provide important insights, particularly when assessing whether capital \\nallocation and research-and-development plans make the most of a company’s capacity through available technologies to decarbonize \\nits business model. In this way, they deepen the forward-looking and sector-specific aspects of the IIGCC’s criteria. In fact, having 6 NET-ZERO ALIGNMENT: BEYOND THE NUMBERS \\nanalyst input enables us to score many companies that would not otherwise be captured by traditional ESG data providers, either \\nbecause they are privately owned or because they are important bond issuers but small in the equity market. This is another reason \\nwhy we believe net-zero alignment is best approached actively rather than passively. \\nWe believe analysts can bring these invaluable real-time insights to the assessment of all six of the net-zero alignment sub-indicators. \\n\\nLong-Term Ambition \\n\\nWhat has the company committed to?  \\n\\n•\\n\\nBoard has understood the strategic \\nimportance of transition  \\n\\n•\\n\\nStrategic decision making factors in \\nclimate  \\n\\n•\\n\\nTrust and belief in company executive \\nto execute on commitments \\n\\nShort- & Medium-Term Targets \\n\\nHow has the company followed up \\ntheir commitment with credible \\ntargets?  \\n\\n•\\n\\nAll climate targets and commitments \\nshould be informed by current \\nemissions performance metrics, to \\nunderstand whether the target of \\ncommitment is credible \\n\\nEmissions Performance \\n\\nHow is the company tracking progress \\ntoward the targets?  \\n\\n•\\n\\nCurrent emissions intensity \\nperformance relative to targets  \\n\\n•\\n\\nGiven data lag in emissions disclosures \\nthrough third-party data providers, \\nanalysts can often provide more recent \\nfigures \\n\\nDisclosure \\n\\nHow is the company reporting \\nprogress toward the targets?  \\n\\n•\\n\\nDisclosure of Scope 1, 2 and material \\nScope 3 emissions  \\n\\n•\\n\\nAnalysts opine on credibility of \\ndisclosures and can often provide \\nmore recent figures \\n\\nDecarbonization Strategy \\n\\nDoes the company have credible plans \\nto decarbonize?  \\n\\n•\\n\\nDemonstration of a credible plan for \\nreaching net zero in the context of \\nwhat is feasible given technology and \\nsector expectations \\n\\nCapital Allocation \\n\\nIs the company dedicating resources to \\ndecarbonize?  \\n\\n•\\n\\nIdentify sector-specific technology \\ninnovation feasibility  \\n\\n•\\n\\nDemonstration of capital expenditure \\nand budgeting to deliver GHG target \\nTo demonstrate what this means in practice, here are two examples of meaningful interventions made by our own analysts, one \\nconcerning a privately-owned company and the other a public company. \\nJAGUAR LAND ROVER \\nIndicator \\nQuant Score \\n(1-5) \\nAnalyst-Adjusted \\nScore (1-5)  Score Breakdown \\n\\n\\nLong-term Ambition  5 5 Net-zero commitment captured by SBTi \\n\\n\\nShort- and Medium-Term Targets  4 4 Short- and medium-term targets validated by SBTi \\n\\n\\nEmissions Performance  1 3 Declining emissions intensity trajectory over a three-year period \\n\\n\\nDisclosures  1 4 Discloses Scope 1 and 2 emissions \\n\\n\\nDecarbonization Strategy  1 3 Confirmed quantified decarbonization strategy \\n\\n\\nCapital Allocation  1 1 Does not have a capital allocation strategy in place or \\n\\n\\nany basis to estimate green capex \\nTotal Score  13  20  Aligning NET-ZERO ALIGNMENT: BEYOND THE NUMBERS  7\\n“As a private company, many of Jaguar Land Rover’s efforts to transition to net zero were not captured by traditional ESG data \\nproviders.

In our view, there was insufficient reported data to establish either a three-year declining \\nemissions intensity trend, or compatibility of the company’s current emissions intensity with Paris-aligned emissions pathways. \\nOn that basis, we downgraded the emissions performance sub-indicator. For this type of issue, we would typically start by \\nengaging on improving disclosure, followed by making a net-zero commitment, and ultimately monitor how this affects emissions \\nperformance over time. As such, we engaged with the issuer on formalizing an emissions reduction pathway with quantitative \\ntargets. While the issuer will include an emissions reduction plan in its next ESG report, it told us it will not commit to specific \\ntargets in the report nor does it plan to establish quantitative targets in the future. The information gained through our \\nengagement activity reinforces our downgrade of the Net-Zero Alignment Indicator and underlines our view that the issuer is a \\nlaggard compared to peers.” \\nKelly Weber, Senior Research Analyst—Investment Grade 8 NET-ZERO ALIGNMENT: BEYOND THE NUMBERS \\nAs active managers, we strongly believe that data is only the starting point when it comes to ESG analysis, and that analyst judgement \\nis essential. To illustrate the importance of this stage to our Net-Zero Alignment Indicator process, let’s look at the override results we \\nsaw from the first Indicator assessment of our Climate Transition Multi-Asset credit strategy, which deploys multiple tools in pursuit of \\na goal of net-zero emissions. 8\\nFIGURE 1.

This confirms our intuition about the additional insights our analysts can bring. \\nScores associated with issuers of bank loans and high yield bonds were subjected to the largest proportion of upgrades by asset class, \\nwhich is consistent with lower availability of quantitative data and third-party assessments for issuers active in those markets. \\nSub-indicators 4, “Disclosure” and 6, “Capital Allocation,” were subjected to by far the largest proportion of overrides, reflecting \\nsubstantial lags in emissions data and the importance of specialist qualitative judgement in assessing companies’ spending and \\ninvestment plans. The reason sub-indicator 3, “Emissions Performance,” was subjected to the fewest overrides is that most issuers have \\nnot disclosed actual emissions for long enough to allow analysts to compare them directly with previous emissions projections. \\nNote that these results are from the first occasion on which this portfolio was scored with the Net-Zero Alignment Indicator. They show \\nthe overrides that were necessary given the score based on the “raw” quantitative data. Next time the portfolio is scored, analysts will \\nneed to reaffirm or update their previous adjustments, but there are likely to be far fewer additional overrides required. \\nConclusion: Beyond the Numbers \\nAs governments worldwide commit to emissions-reduction targets, companies and investors increasingly recognize the need to manage \\nthe risk of misalignment. \\nSome investors will simply wish to divest from companies that are substantially misaligned. Others may wish to build an assessment of \\ncompany alignment into their ESG-integrated investment strategies. Increasingly, we also see a third class of investors who want to set \\ntheir own portfolios onto a path to net-zero emissions. Many of these investors recognize that, to achieve a net-zero portfolio without \\nsweeping divestments from high-emitting sectors where there is greatest scope to achieve real-world emissions reduction, they and \\ntheir asset managers need to engage with companies to monitor and encourage credible strategies for alignment. \\nAll three types of investor can benefit from using a rigorous process for assessing net-zero alignment, designed and utilized by an active \\nmanager with substantial fundamental-research capabilities. \\nFor the third class of investor, fundamental-research capabilities and insights are particularly important, because they can inform \\ncorporate engagement programs. As active managers, engagement is a key part of Neuberger Berman’s investment process. Our \\nanalysts and portfolio managers conduct between 4,000 and 5,000 engagement meetings with company management each year, \\nand usually around a third of those involve conversations on climate topics. Where an investor has a substantial company engagement \\nprogram, the NB Net-Zero Alignment Indicator introduces an additional feedback loop: insights from engagement feed into the scores, \\nand those evolving scores then help us to track and focus engagement on issuers’ specific areas of weakness. \\nIt is this experience that has informed the development of our Net-Zero Alignment Indicator and persuaded us of the critical importance \\nof going “beyond the numbers” when assessing company’s net-zero alignment.

      "\n",
      "Neuberger Berman, a prominent asset management firm, has developed a Net-Zero Alignment Indicator to assess companies' progress towards net-zero emissions alignment. This innovative tool is designed to go \"beyond the numbers\" by integrating fundamental research and analyst insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Need for Independent Assessment:** Neuberger Berman argues that relying solely on existing \"Paris-Aligned\" or \"Climate Transition\" indices is insufficient due to flaws in data completeness and regulatory parameters. These benchmarks often achieve emissions reductions by reducing the weight of high-emitting sectors, which the firm deems a suboptimal approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Neuberger Berman's Net-Zero Alignment Indicator:** The indicator is a three-step process involving:\n",
      "   - **Quantitative Scoring:** Utilizing over 30 data points from third-party vendors to generate scores (1-5) for six sub-indicators: Long-Term Ambition, Short- and Medium-Term Targets, Emissions Performance, Disclosure, Decarbonization Strategy, and Capital Allocation.\n",
      "   - **Analyst Validation:** Analysts can override initial scores based on direct engagement with companies, sustainability reports, or credible third-party sources, ensuring a forward-looking and sector-specific evaluation.\n",
      "   - **Final Score:** Summing sub-indicator scores to produce an overall net-zero alignment score (1-30) mapped to one of five alignment statuses: Achieving Net Zero, Aligned with a Net-Zero Pathway, Aligning with a Net-Zero Pathway, Committed to Aligning with a Net-Zero Pathway, and Not Aligned.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Analyst Insights:** Analysts play a critical role in the process, providing real-time insights and oversight. Their expertise helps in evaluating companies that might otherwise be overlooked by traditional ESG data providers, especially privately-owned or significant bond issuers in the equity market.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Engagement and Feedback Loop:** For investors with substantial engagement programs, the Net-Zero Alignment Indicator introduces a feedback loop. Insights from engagement inform the scores, and evolving scores help focus engagement on specific areas of weakness within companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Relevance for Different Investors:** The tool benefits all types of investors: those wishing to divest from misaligned companies, those integrating ESG into investment strategies, and those aiming to set their portfolios on a net-zero emissions path. For the latter, fundamental research and insights are crucial for informing corporate engagement programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Recognition and Case Study:** Neuberger Berman's approach has gained recognition, including a case study by Harvard Business School titled \"Investing in the Climate Transition at Neuberger Berman,\" which explores the development and application of the Net-Zero Alignment Indicator.\n",

      "## The Limitations of Existing Net-Zero Benchmarks\n",
      "\n",
      "While numerous \"Paris-Aligned\" or \"Climate Transition\" indices have emerged, Neuberger Berman argues that these benchmarks suffer from several flaws. The European Union's regulatory framework, which defines the parameters for these benchmarks, forces them to achieve emissions reductions primarily through reducing the weight of high-emitting sectors. This approach, according to Neuberger Berman, is a blunt instrument that often results in major sectoral bets against the broad market and overlooks opportunities to support businesses with credible emissions reduction plans.\n",

      "## Neuberger Berman's Net-Zero Alignment Indicator\n",
      "\n",
      "The NZAI is a three-step process designed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of companies' net-zero alignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Quantitative Scoring:** The NZAI utilizes over 30 data points from third-party vendors to generate scores (1-5) for six sub-indicators: Long-Term Ambition, Short- and Medium-Term Targets, Emissions Performance, Disclosure, Decarbonization Strategy, and Capital Allocation. These sub-indicators mirror the criteria set out by the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change (IIGCC).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Analyst Validation:** Analysts can override initial scores based on direct engagement with companies, sustainability reports, or credible third-party sources. This step ensures a forward-looking and sector-specific evaluation, capturing nuances that may be missed by purely quantitative methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Final Score:** The sub-indicator scores are summed to produce an overall net-zero alignment score (1-30), which is then mapped to one of five alignment statuses: Achieving Net Zero, Aligned with a Net-Zero Pathway, Aligning with a Net-Zero Pathway, Committed to Aligning with a Net-Zero Pathway, and Not Aligned.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Critical Role of Analyst Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "Neuberger Berman's analysts play a critical role in the NZAI process. Their expertise helps in evaluating companies that might otherwise be overlooked by traditional ESG data providers, especially privately-owned or significant bond issuers in the equity market. For instance, in the case of Jaguar Land Rover, analysts were able to evidence upgrades for three sub-indicators based on their knowledge of the company and its public sustainability reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Engagement and Feedback Loop\n",
      "\n",
      "For investors with substantial engagement programs, the NZAI introduces a feedback loop. Insights from engagement feed into the scores, and those evolving scores then help track and focus engagement on issuers' specific areas of weakness. This dynamic approach ensures that investment strategies remain responsive to companies' progress in addressing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Benefits for Different Investor Types\n",
      "\n",
      "The NZAI benefits all types of investors: those wishing to divest from misaligned companies, those integrating ESG into investment strategies, and those aiming to set their portfolios on a net-zero emissions path. For the latter, fundamental research and insights are crucial for informing corporate engagement programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recognition and Case Study\n",
      "\n",
      "Neuberger Berman's innovative approach to sustainable investing has gained recognition, including a case study by Harvard Business School titled \"Investing in the Climate Transition at Neuberger Berman.\" This case study explores the development and application of the NZAI, highlighting the firm's commitment to active management in the climate transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Neuberger Berman's Net-Zero Alignment Indicator represents a significant step forward in assessing companies' progress towards net-zero emissions alignment. By combining quantitative data with analyst insights and fostering a dynamic engagement process, the NZAI provides investors with a powerful tool for navigating the climate transition and shaping a more sustainable future for investments.\n"
